Hi, we're Häusle in Cornwall. An English family promoting its Cornish Cottage in Redruth to our lovely German tourists who know something of Cornwall through Rosamund Pilcher or Elisabeth Kabatek.

<br />

We're very proud of our cottage, Cornwall and all its delights and foibles. We want to share our Cornish adventure with you and invite you to come here on holiday!

<br />

In this blog, you will find stories about what the English think of Cornwall.
